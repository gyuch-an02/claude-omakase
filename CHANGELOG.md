## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Starter-pack onboarding is now a checklist.** `recommend_skills` returns the full starter pack (mode `starter-pack`) and every missing staple (mode `starter-pack-gap`) with `present_as: "checklist"`, so first-time and returning users can select and install any subset at once. This is the one deliberate exception to omakase's "serve exactly one" rule — all other modes still return a single pick. `omakase-chef/SKILL.md` updated to match.

### Added
- **Deterministic repetition detector** (`hooks/omakase-repetition.mjs`) — opt-in `PostToolUse(Bash)` hook that counts repeated command signatures (single commands, plus multi-step chained/sequential workflows via n-gram detection) and nudges Claude to call `find_skill` once a workflow repeats 3×. Replaces the soft, model-judgment-only repetition trigger with a reliable one for demos. Not auto-wired by `install.sh` — register it manually.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **MCP sampling for `propose_new_skill`** — Claude writes a tailored SKILL.md from scratch using `sampling/createMessage` instead of a generic template
- **Starter pack** — `recommend_skills` returns 4 universally useful skills (grill-me, understand-anything, write-a-skill, quick-review) when no skills are installed
- **4 new catalog adapters** → catalog grows from 3 to 400+ entries:
  - `mcp-servers-repo` — Anthropic's [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
  - `awesome-mcp` — community [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)
  - `skillsmp` fixed — nested `data.skills` response shape now handled correctly
- **True omakase UX** — omakase-chef SKILL.md rewritten: one recommendation per moment, not a menu; always shows trigger phrase after install
- **Automated publishing** via npm Trusted Publishing (GitHub Actions OIDC, `environment: npm`)
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, badges (npm, CI, MIT), community health files

### Fixed
- `skillsmp` adapter: was always returning 0 entries due to response shape mismatch
- Template placeholder substitution in `propose_new_skill` (`{{slug}}` etc. now render correctly)
- `recommend_skills` default limit reduced to 1 (omakase = one course at a time)

### Changed
- `omakase-chef/SKILL.md` completely rewritten to enforce chef-picks-one philosophy

---
